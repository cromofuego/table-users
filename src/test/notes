{/* because if a take, the user select 10 data per page so i divied that in the number footer page,
  i will get soem like this
10/3 = 3.3 but with ceil is 4
10/5 = 2
10/7 = 1.4 but with ceil is 2
10/4 = 2.5 but with ceilt is 3
and the result from every division is the amoutn that i need number of page posible
selected by the user in teh footer
so in this case if the filter  info is for a total of 10 and ai divide that i for the selection user in
this case 7 a will get 1.4 with ceil is 2, so if not is major o iquality to seven i will not render this
posibility to tap from user because that will no have nothing XD */}
